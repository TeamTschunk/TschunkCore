# TschunkCore

This repository contains the main parts of our code for the [2015 EUhackathon](http://www.2015.euhackathon.eu/participants/#team-tschunk).

## Proposal

**Bring code to life!**

Place small code-blocks on a table and see its effects on a screen.

We want to use augmented reality technology to make the power of code tangible: children should be able to create and modify small programs on a table by
placing code-blocks and forming a "path" through the instructions.

A webcam films the table and shows the created program, augmented by an avatar which walks through the program, on a screen. The children then can change the program and immediately see the effects of the change on the screen.
Special functions, like simple image manipulation, can be introduced as blocks, which makes it easy to extend this system.

Doing so we want to show the power of even small code in a simple, interactive and entertaining way. This can be used in classrooms, at exhibitions, workshops, and other events.

Visual programming + "oh I can touch my code" are a thing!

The project itself is entirely new, so no code has yet been written.
The code will probably be based on an existing augmented reality technology framework or use a computer vision library (like OpenCV).
